This is a OnePage site where you can get some random quotes!
it was created with Html and customized with Css and Bootstrap5. Then with JavaScript I created two functions that allow me every time I click the "New Quote" button to generate a different background color and select a random quote from the array I created.

My Next step:

Create a Dropdown button where you can see all my projects. --- Ongoing

Once you click the twitter button you will be directed on your twitter account to share the quote
