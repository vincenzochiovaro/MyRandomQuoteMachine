This is a OnePage site where you can get some random quotes!
 it was created with Html and customized with Css and Bootstrap5. Then with JavaScript I created two functions that allow me every time I click the "New Quote" button to generate a different background color and select a random quote from the array I created.


Uploaded on GitHub Pages: https://vincenzochiovaro.github.io/MyRandomQuoteMachine/


My Next step is to make all the buttons working,  

for example: 

Create a Dropdown button where you can see all my projects. --- Ongoing


Once you click Log In will Pop out a Form where you can interact with it same for the SignUp.


Contact Me page will give you all the information about me.


Once you click the twitter button you will be directed on your twitter account to share the quote
